Published here are the crypto challenges for the 2010 CSAW Application CTF as
described on the Gotham Digital Science blog [1].  There are a few modules that
this source relies on, noted under Dependencies below.

To run these challenges, simply:

    $ python csaw_qualifying.py

or

    $ python csaw_finals.py


Notes:
When running the final challenge, on startup it will ask for a password to
generate the keys.  If you enter a different password each time, the challenge
flag will be different as well.  If you wish to have the flag, make sure that
you enter the same password at startup.


Dependencies:
* CherryPy Framework [http://www.cherrypy.org/]
* PyCrypto [http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/]
